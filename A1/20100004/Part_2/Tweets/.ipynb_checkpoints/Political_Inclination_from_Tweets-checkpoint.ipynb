    "# Was that Tweet Posted by a Republican?\n",
    "Can you tell whether a tweet was posted by a republican? You only have access to the text (tweet) that an unknown person wrote, your job is to tell whether that unknown person was a republican (Trump, Pence or GOP) or a democrat? This is exactly what we'll do in this notebook. \n",

    "## Preprocessing Raw Tweets and Feature Extraction:\n",
    "For those who have some familiarity with Machine Learning, note that preprocessing of data and feature extraction are parts of full Machine Learning ML [pipeline](https://hub.packtpub.com/automl-build-machine-learning-pipeline-tutorial/). The first part of this notebook will teach you and test you on `preprocessing` data in the context of 'Natural Language Processing' using the classic NLP library [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org). For example, in class you learned and discussed enthusiastically [stemming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming) and [lemmatizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatisation) with sir Asim. Now, you'll get hands on experience with those processes and other nitty gritty similar stuff that comes in handy in Natural Language Processing. <br>In the second part of this notebook, you'll convert that preprocessed data into TF-IDF Matrix using another famous library in Machine Learning called [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)- instead of implementing TF-IDF from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be preprocessing the Twitter data we extracted using [this](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api) api. We extracted the tweets posted by the following six Twitter accounts: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP, HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`. Note that `Data Extraction` is also a part of an ML Pipeline which we have already done for you for this notebook. Data Extraction can sometimes be the most challenging part though. \n",
    "\n",
    "For every tweet, we collected two pieces of information:\n",
    "- `screen_name`: the Twitter handle of the user tweeting and\n",
    "- `text`: the content of the tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided the tweets into two parts - the [train and test sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets).  The training set contains both the `screen_name` and `text` of each tweet; the test set only contains the `text`. Have a look at the dataset in files called `tweets_train.csv.gz` and `tweets_test.csv.gz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching goal of the problem is to infer the political inclination (whether **R**epublican or **D**emocratic) of the author from the tweet text. The ground truth (i.e., true class labels) are determined from the `screen_name` of the tweet as follows:\n",
    "- **R**: `realDonaldTrump, mike_pence, GOP`\n",
    "- **D**: `HillaryClinton, timkaine, TheDemocrats`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can treat this as a binary classification problem. We'll follow this common structure to tackling this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **preprocessing**: clean up the raw tweet text using the various functions offered by [the Natural Language Toolkit (`nltk`)](http://www.nltk.org/genindex.html).\n",
    "2. **features**: construct bag-of-words feature vectors- [TFIDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf–idf) matrix.\n",
    "3. **classification**: learn a binary classification model using [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `nltk` supports optional corpora, toy grammars, trained models, etc. For this assignment, you have to manually install the stopwords list and `WordNetLemmatizer`. We'll begin by installing them:"

And Python does have a regex [library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) for you. Use them whenever you can. A beautiful line of regex can replace a chunk of ugly code. Once you've sufficient experience with regex, only then you'll really appreciate its utility. <br>\n",
    "**Stopwords** are words that appear very often in text, usually playing a grammatical role (\"and\", \"a\", etc.).

    " - test your URL stripping! It's very easy to make a mistake with it.\n",
    " - When lemmatizing, you should convert the output to `str` (i.e. `lemmatized_word = str(lemmatizer.lemmatize(word))`) because the lemmatizer may return a non-string object."

    "Now we have each tweet as a list of words, excluding words with high- and low-frequencies. We want to convert these into a [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) feature matrix, where each row corresponds to a tweet and each column to a possible word. Odds are you have not seen TFIDF before; You may also find supplementary notes helpful. However, you'll not implement TFIDF from scratch rather use a library function. We can use [`TfidfVectorizer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) of [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to do this quite easily). \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a catch, though: `TfidfVectorizer` expects the input to be a string, and (by default) it perfoms its own analyzing. You have to override that behavior by passing in `do_nothing` to the constructor as an optional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Read [the documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#customizing-the-vectorizer-classes) carefully, and then this [blog post](http://www.davidsbatista.net/blog/2018/02/28/TfidfVectorizer/) ([mirror](http://archive.is/pVdqE)). You need to pass in `do_nothing` in two locations.\n",
    " - You should use only the training data to `fit` or `fit_transform` the vectorizer."
